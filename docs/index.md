# Welcome to ATHENA

Track your portfolio, individual positions, forex, and other financial instruments in one place. Pull data from the Federal Reserve, Yahoo! Finance, and custom sources. Track metrics to benchmark yourself against hedge funds. Use LLMs to manage your portfolio.

Athena is a toolkit designed to easily track investments and delegate decision-making to a large language model. Our vision is to have LLMs help with tracking major news developments, run scenario analyses, and ultimately open and close positions.

The data structure lives in Excel; it can be edited by you to input positions, override choices, or incorporate your existing portfolios.

**This is an experimental toolkit.** It should be used to inform your research and does not represent any sort of official investment advice.
