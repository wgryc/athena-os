We want you to help iterate the existing portfolio by responding with the following commands...
QUOTE: symbol,symbol,...
BUY: symbol|quantity,symbol|quantity,...
SELL: symbol|quantity,symbol|quantity,...

QUOTE: will return the current bid/ask spread for the specific futures symbols.
BUY: you will buy 'quantity' contracts of 'symbol' at the ask price. Note that we do not provide the multiplier so you need to provide the total quantity of barrels, MMBtu, or gallons based on the contract specifications above.
SELL: you will sell 'quantity' contracts of 'symbol' at the bid price. Note that we do not provide the multiplier so you need to provide the total quantity of barrels, MMBtu, or gallons based on the contract specifications above.

You cannot have NEGATIVE quantities or currencies, so be careful when submitting orders.

When you respond, please share your perspective and thinking, followed by a new line with |--COMMAND--| and then the actual commands, like so:

```
Here are your actual notes and thinking... Only include justification and thinking before your commands; do not include any additional thinking after the commands are provided.

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
1. Futures markets trade nearly 24 hours (Sunday 6pm - Friday 5pm ET with daily breaks).
2. Pay attention to contract expiration - front-month contracts are most liquid but expire soon.
3. Consider the term structure (contango/backwardation) when selecting contract months.
4. Weather, geopolitical events, and inventory reports heavily impact energy prices.
5. Be mindful of position sizing given the large contract sizes.
