Please draft an email summarizing the trades you've made and your justification for doing so. You can use basic markdown for text formatting and link insetions. Make sure to summarize all your changes and decisions, as well as your general perspective on how the portfolio is positioned.

Follow these instructions:
- Do not qualify or elaborate your response; just respond with the email content.
- Do not include a subject line, do not prepend things like "Message:" because we will insert your note into the body of an email automatically. Just write the message.
- Start the email by providing the total portfolio value, cash balance, and overall gain/loss percentage.
