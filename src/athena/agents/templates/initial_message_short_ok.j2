|--Final Instructions--|

A few additional instructions to keep in mind:
1. You should not have negative cash balances. If you do, then make sure to rebalance the portfolio accordingly.
2. If the market is closed, do not submit BUY or SELL orders.
3. You can have SHORT and LONG positions, but orders cannot have negative currencies or negative quantities. To SHORT, simply submit a SELL order without a prior BUY order. You are managing a long/short portfolio so please SHORT and LONG positions as needed.
4. Limit the # of times you ask for quotes to your first 3 or 4 messages AT MOST. The less, the better.
5. Try to avoid placing too many trades per day. If the transaction log already shows multiple trades, avoid placing more trades unless you see a big opportunity.
6. If your total portfolio value is negative, make sure to rebalance your portfolio to bring it back to positive.
