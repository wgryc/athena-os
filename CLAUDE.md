# Instructions for Claude Code

1. Please use the virtual environment in .v or .venv If neither exists, confirm with the user what the virtual environment should be. Never run `ATHENA` without a virtual environment.
2. Review README.md to understand our architecture.
3. Review CACHE.md if working on any data pulls.
4. Review STYLE.md when building any frontend experiences or user interfaces.
5. We use `mkdocs` for documentation."Use Google-style docstrings when writing code.
6. We use `pytest` for tests. Where possible, please add relevant test cases. If your tests require external files (e.g., a portfolio) make sure to include those in the `tests` folder as well.
